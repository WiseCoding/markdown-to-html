## Funny story
I once jumped with my face against a basketball ring :basketball: while in a trampoline park with a lot of small kids. I just hope their nightmares have faded by now. My whole face was bleeding and I had to get stitches. Also my humour can be strange? :thinking:
### TL;DR
Don't go to a trampoline park with me. :grin:
